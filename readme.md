This repo stores benchmarks for the project using LLM.

As for the simple test folder, it only tests a function 'sizeof' in C language. To show the result, you can directly run the 'main' void in 'simple test/src/sizeofTest.java'. The expected result is, ignoring warning messages, it prints 'Size of MyObject instance: 32 bytes' twice. Actually, it calculates the size of a struct defined in both sizeOfTest.java and sizeof.c, in two different ways, one is using Unsafe as another is using FFM api.

Note that there exists two problems for the simple test. One is, when using FFM api to calculate the size, I simply defined the same struct in sizeof.c, which is not a good solution. That means, as long as I change the struct in the java file, I should also change sizeof.c. Another problem is, in the struct, if we define ```char[] str``` in both files, the result looks good. However, if we use String instead, the result of java file and C file differs. A potential reason is the memory management method of the two languages have a little difference, as the exact reason is not clear yet.

As for the test from 'My Well Grounded Java', it contains two versions of a simple project about a bank account. The ```Account.java``` is an interface, and there are three kinds of accounts. Note that there are tests for each type of accounts. The unsafe version allocate memory for the variable ```balance```, while the FFM version allocate off-heap memory to do the same thing. Tests for atomic and synchronized accounts all work well, as tests for var handled accounts sometimes fail, for both FFM version and unsafe version. Hence the failure occurs due to the unsafe version itself but not the way I modify it.
